These ##      identifiers can then be used to reliably look up the compound in ##      any of the included databases. ##  ## Usage: ##  ##      queryUniChem( ##        compound, ##        type = c(\"sourceID\", \"uci\", \"inchi\", \"inchikey\"), ##        sourceID = \"pubchem\", ##        ..., ##        connectivity = FALSE, ##        BPPARAM = BiocParallel::bpparam() ##      ) ##       ## Arguments: ##  ## compound: 'character()' Vector of machine readable compound identifiers ##           for the specified 'type'. When 'type=\"sourceID\"' the ##           compounds must be valid identifers from the from specified ##           'sourceID' database. When compound is omitted this function ##           calls 'getUniChemSources' and displays available databases to ##           map between. ##  ##     type: 'character(1)' The kind of compound representation for the ##           molecule to search. Options are \"uci\" for UniChem ID, \"inchi\" ##           for InChI, \"inchikey\" for InChIKey or \"sourceID\" mapping ##           between databases. Default is \"sourceID\". ##  ## sourceID: 'numeric(1)' or 'character(1)' Either a UniChem source ##           database integer id or the name of a database to look up the ##           key for. This should match \"sourceID\" from ##           'getUniChemCompound()' when sourceID is numeric or \"name\" ##           when it is character. Default source ID is \"pubchem\", ##           accepting valid PubChem compound IDs. ##  ##      ...: 'pairlist' Fall through parameters to 'httr::POST' via ##           'httr:RETRY'. Pass 'httr::verbose()' to see full details of ##           the query being constructed. ##  ## connectivity: 'logical(1)' Should the connectivity API be queried ##           instead? This will treat your compound as a mixture and ##           return sub-components, isotopes or other slight variations on ##           the query molecule. Default is 'FALSE', which only matches ##           exactly.
