</h2>
<p>The UniChem database provides a publicly available REST API for
programmatic retrieval of mappings from standardized structural compound
identifiers to unique compound IDs across a range of large online
cheminformatic databases such as PubChem, ChEMBL, DrugBank and many
more. The service accepts POST requests to two different end-points:
<code>/compound</code> and <code>/connectivity</code>. Both endpoints
accept query parameters via the POST body in JSON format. The
<code>/compound</code> API returns exact matches for the queried
compound, while the <code>/connectivity</code> API uses layers of the
International Chemical Identifier (InChI) of the query compound to
return exact matches as well as structurally related compounds such as
isomers, salts, ionizations and more. <span class="citation">(<span>“<span>UniChem</span> 2.0
<span>Beta</span>,”</span> n.d.; Chambers et al. 2013)</span></p>
<p>The functions in <code>AnnotationGx</code> have been designed to
allow package users to easily query UniChem resources without any
pre-existing knowledge of HTTP requests or the API specifications. In
doing so we hope to provide an R native interface for mapping between
various cheminformatic databases, accessible to anyone familar with
using R functions!</p>

<p>The primary function for querying the UniChem API in
<code>AnnotationGx</code> is <code>queryUniChem</code>. Within the R
terminal, you can consult the function documentation by typing

is displayed here for convenience:</p>

</h3>
<p>The most reliable method for retrieving information from UniChem is
by using a structural identifier, if it is available in your compound
annotations. This is because structural identifiers tend to be more
stable than database specific idenifiers, which can evolve over time as
database are updated with the most recent compound information.</p>
<p>The simplest case is the InChIKey, which is just a unique hash
computed from the much longer full InChI string for that compound.</p>
<p>Below we will retrieve all available database identifiers for the
anti-neoplastic drugs Erlotinib and Paclitaxel. The returned table
includes all available identifiers, which columns indicating the source
database. To get the identifier for your target database, simply filter
the results table via the <code>shortName</code> or
<code>longName</code> columns which indicate the source of each mapped
identfier.</p>

</h3>
<p>While structural identifiers are the preferred method for UniChem
look-ups, they are often unavailable in the compound annotations of
published datasets. Therefore, we need to utilize whichever standard
database identifier the data generators have included. Since PubChem is
the most frequent standard identifier included, we have make the
defaults for cross database look-ups to use this source.</p>
<p>Again, we will look up identfiers for Erlotinib and Paclitaxel, but
this time using their ChEMBL ids.</p>

<p>It is also possible to look up compounds using the full InChI string
or their unique UniChem ID by changing the <code>type</code> argument.
Details are available in the function documentation:
<code><a href="../reference/queryUniChem.html">?queryUniChem</a></code>.</p>

</h3>
<p>In this case, the UniChem API will not be able to help solve your
annotation issues. Instead you will need to attempt a name look up using
one of the UniChem databases to get a standard idenfier, then use that
with the <code>queryUniChem</code> function if you need additional
idenfiers. We suggest using the PubChem API via the
<code>queryPubChem</code> function. See
<code><a href="../articles/PubChemAPIQueries.html">vignette("PubChemAPIQueries")</a></code> for a tutorial!</p>
